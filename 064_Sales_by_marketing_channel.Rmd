Given the following [data set](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s_gYPvxtgO9ufb-q2TO4n9_TCe7I-RorkbDYYegMm4c/edit#gid=33674467), can you plot a chart that shows the percent of revenue by marketing source? You can assume that purchase_value is revenue in this case, and you'll have to calculate the percent of revenue by source prior to plotting.
